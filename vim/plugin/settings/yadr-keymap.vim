" RSI Prevention - keyboard remaps
" ========================================
" Certain things we do every day as programmers stress
" out our hands. For example, typing underscores and
" dashes are very common, and in position that require
" a lot of hand movement. Vim to the rescue
"
" Now using the middle finger of either hand you can type
" underscores with apple-k or apple-d, and add Shift
" to type dashes
imap <silent> <D-k> _
imap <silent> <D-d> _
imap <silent> <D-K> -
imap <silent> <D-D> -

" simultaneously to go to the beginning or end of line

"Go to last edit location with ,.
nnoremap ,. '.

"When typing a string, your quotes auto complete. Move past the quote
"while still in insert mode by hitting Ctrl-a. Example:
"
" type 'foo<c-a>
"
" the first quote will autoclose so you'll get 'foo' and hitting <c-a> will
" put the cursor right after the quote
