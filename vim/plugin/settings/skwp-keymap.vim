" RSI Prevention - keyboard remaps
" ========================================
" Certain things we do every day as programmers stress
" out our hands. For example, typing underscores and 
" dashes are very common, and in position that require
" a lot of hand movement. Vim to the rescue 
"
" Now using the middle finger of either hand you can type
" underscores with apple-k or apple-d, and add Shift
" to type dashes
imap <silent> <D-k> _
imap <silent> <D-d> _
imap <silent> <D-K> -
imap <silent> <D-D> -
" Don't have to use Shift to get into command mode, just hit semicolon

"Go to last edit location with ,.
nnoremap ,. '.
