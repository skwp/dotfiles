" vim --noplugin -u vim/vundles.vim -N "+set hidden" "+syntax on" +PluginClean! +PluginInstall +qall

" This reduces churn and makes it easier to fork. See

runtime git.vundle
runtime appearance.vundle
runtime textobjects.vundle
runtime search.vundle
runtime project.vundle
runtime vim-improvements.vundle

" The plugins listed in ~/.vim/.vundles.local will be added here to
" allow the user to add vim plugins to yadr without the need for a fork.
