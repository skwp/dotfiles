" The tree buffer makes it easy to drill down through the directories of your
" git repository, but it’s not obvious how you could go up a level to the
" parent directory. Here’s a mapping of .. to the above command, but
" only for buffers containing a git blob or tree
autocmd User fugitive
  \ if get(b:, 'fugitive_type', '') =~# '^\%(tree\|blob\)$' |
  \   nnoremap <buffer> .. :edit %:h<CR> |
  \ endif

" Every time you open a git object using fugitive it creates a new buffer.
" This means that your buffer listing can quickly become swamped with
" fugitive buffers. This prevents this from becomming an issue:

autocmd BufReadPost fugitive://* set bufhidden=delete
