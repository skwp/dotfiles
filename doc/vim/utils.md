* SplitJoin - easily split up things like ruby hashes into multiple lines or join them back together. Try :SplitjoinJoin and :SplitjoinSplit or use the bindings sj(split) and sk(unsplit) - mnemonically j and k are directions down and up
* tabularize - align code effortlessly by using :Tabularize /[character] to align by a character, or try the keymaps
* yankring - effortless sanity for pasting. every time you yank something it goes into a buffer. after hitting p to paste, use ctrl-p or ctrl-n to cycle through the paste options. great for when you accidentally overwrite your yank with a delete.
* surround - super easy quote and tag manipulation - ysiw" - sourround inner word with quotes. ci"' - change inner double quotes to single quotes, etc
* greplace - use :Gsearch to find across many files, replace inside the changes, then :Greplace to do a replace across all matches - made lightning fast with Silver Searcher
* vim-markdown-preview - :Mm to view your README.md as html
* html-escape - ,he and ,hu to escape and unescape html
* Gundo - visualize your undos - pretty amazing plugin. Hit ,u with my keymappings to trigger it, very user friendly
* vim-indent-guides - visual indent guides, off by default
* color_highlight - use :ColorCodes to see hex colors highlighted
* change-inside-surroundings - change content inside delimiters like quotes/brackets
* rspec.vim - used for color highlighting rspec correctly even if specs live outside of spec/ (rails.vim doesn't handle this)
* Ag - use :Ag to search across multiple files. Faster than Grep and Ack.
* vim-session: use `:SaveSession` and `:OpenSession` to come back to your saved window layout
